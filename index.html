    <h2>A Message for Those Who Dare to Dream</h2>
    <p>The truth is simple: People fear what they don’t understand. They’ll say no, they’ll refuse, they’ll shut down anything that challenges their view of the world—often without even trying to see it from a different perspective. History is filled with skeptics, doubters, and naysayers, but the future belongs to the bold.</p>
    <p>The choice is yours. But remember this: While some sit and wait for the world to change, others are already writing its next chapter. Which side will you be on?</p>
