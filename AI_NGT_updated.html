            <h2>The Story Behind AI N.G.T</h2>
            <p>AI N.G.T was born from the realization that artificial intelligence and blockchain are not just tools—they are gateways to the future. This project takes inspiration from pioneers like Mo Gawdat, who transitioned from major tech roles at Google and OpenAI to becoming an advocate for AI-driven change.</p>
            <blockquote>In one interview, Mo shared: "AI is a mirror to humanity—it reflects back what we teach it, both the light and the dark."</blockquote>
            <p>With AI N.G.T, we aim to embrace the light: creating a token that inspires innovation, collaboration, and the courage to challenge outdated norms.</p>
