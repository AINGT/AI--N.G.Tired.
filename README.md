## What is AI N.G.T?
AI N.G.T (AI Never Get Tired) is a blockchain project that bridges the gap between Artificial Intelligence (AI) and decentralized finance (DeFi). By leveraging cutting-edge technologies, we aim to redefine financial inclusivity and empower communities.

## Key Features:
- **Deflationary Model:** Automated token burns ensure long-term scarcity.
- **Random Burn Reward (RBR):** A unique mechanism that rewards holders with a portion of burned tokens.
- **Roadmap Milestones:** Public token sale, staking, liquidity mining, and the establishment of a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO).

## Token Information:
- **Blockchain:** Solana (SPL Token) / Ethereum (ERC-20 Compatible)
- **Ticker Symbol:** AINGT
- **Total Supply:** 1 Billion Tokens

## Our Vision
We believe in breaking boundaries and challenging perspectives. AI N.G.T is not just a token; itâ€™s a movement toward embracing the future of AI and blockchain collaboration. 
By combining decentralized mechanisms with real-world AI integration, we are paving the way for something extraordinary.

## Tokenomics
- **Total Supply:** 1 Billion Tokens (1,000,000,000 AI N.G.T)
- **2% Burn Tax:** Every transaction burns 2% of its value, ensuring deflationary tokenomics.
